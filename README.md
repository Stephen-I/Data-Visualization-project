# Data-Visualization-project

I was given some data spanning various aspects of customer sales data. First i had to normalise the data to make it viable for analysis.

Normalising process:
•	Separate all the columns into the different tables of Fact being the measurable values and any other tables
•	Identify the primary keys connecting each of the tables
•	Create the allotted amount of tables in power bi and single out the necessary columns for each
•	Remove any duplicates to prevent errors within the data

Once I had Normalised the data into the 4 seperate tables; 
 -customer
 -Orders
 -Location
 -Product

I also established a calendar table and aligned it with the date column available in the orders table.

Once all the tables were created I made a page for each to make a dashboard for each set of results. To connect them all I made an interactive Index page that allows the user to jump to each individual page
